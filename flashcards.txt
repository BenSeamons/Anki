Which hepatitis viruses are transmitted fecal-orally?	Hepatitis A and E ("vowels from the bowels")
Which hepatitis virus is associated with high mortality in pregnant women?	Hepatitis E
Which hepatitis virus is a DNA virus?	Hepatitis B (partially double-stranded DNA, hepadnavirus)
Which hepatitis viruses can become chronic?	Hepatitis B, C, D (if with B)
Which hepatitis virus is most likely to become chronic?	Hepatitis C (majority progress to chronic infection)
Which hepatitis viruses have a vaccine?	Hepatitis A and B (and by preventing B, you prevent D too)
What is the key viral antigen required for Hepatitis D infection?	Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)
What is the classic route of transmission for hepatitis B and C?	Blood, sexual, and perinatal (vertical)
What is the best marker for acute Hepatitis A infection?	Anti-HAV IgM antibody
What is the best marker for current Hepatitis B infection?	HBsAg (Hepatitis B surface antigen)
What serologic marker indicates Hepatitis B immunity (from vaccine or past infection)?	Anti-HBs (antibody to surface antigen)
What marker is present in someone recently infected with HBV but not after vaccination?	Anti-HBc (antibody to core antigen)
Which Hepatitis B marker indicates high infectivity and active replication?	HBeAg (envelope antigen)
Which serologic marker differentiates acute from chronic HBV infection?	Anti-HBc IgM (acute); Anti-HBc IgG (chronic or resolved)
What marker confirms active Hepatitis C infection?	HCV RNA (by PCR)
Which hepatitis virus has no vaccine and frequently causes chronic infection?	Hepatitis C
Which hepatitis virus requires co-infection or superinfection with Hepatitis B?	Hepatitis D (delta agent)
What is the best way to prevent Hepatitis D infection?	Hepatitis B vaccination (no HBV = no HDV)
What is the likely outcome of Hepatitis A and E infection?	Acute, self-limited (no chronic/carrier state)
What extrahepatic complications are associated with chronic Hepatitis B?	Membranous nephropathy, polyarteritis nodosa, aplastic anemia
What extrahepatic complication is associated with chronic Hepatitis C?	Cryoglobulinemia, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, lichen planus
What is the most serious complication of chronic HBV or HCV infection?	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cirrhosis
What is the “window period” in Hepatitis B infection?	Time when HBsAg and anti-HBs are both negative; only anti-HBc is positive
Which hepatitis virus is associated with outbreaks from contaminated water in developing countries?	Hepatitis E (and A)
Which hepatitis virus is inactivated by the killed vaccine?	Hepatitis A
Which hepatitis B serologic marker is positive in vaccinated (never infected) individuals?	Anti-HBs only
Which hepatitis B serologic markers are positive in someone with resolved infection?	Anti-HBs and anti-HBc IgG (no HBsAg)
What class of drugs are used to treat chronic Hepatitis B and C?	Nucleos(t)ide analogs (HBV: tenofovir, entecavir; HCV: direct-acting antivirals)
Why is there no vaccine for hepatitis C?	Antigenic variation in HCV envelope proteins prevents effective vaccine development
Which hepatitis viruses are naked (non-enveloped)?	Hepatitis A and E (survive stomach acid and GI tract)
